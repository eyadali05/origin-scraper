# origin-scraper
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)


a webscraper that scrapes data of a game url on the origin website using _python **playwright**_

## Why?
was on a project with my team "[PTWCA](https://github.com/PTWCA)" and in the progress of making the project 
I was tasked by making a scraper to get certain data given a url from [origin](https://origin.com).

## Installation
1. `python3 -m pip install playwright` or `pip3 install playwright`
2. playwright install
3. good to go!

## Usage
All you do is run the `scraper.py` file and enter a url of a game on origin when prompted to, then wait for output

## TODO
- [ ] Make it work on replit -_In the case of it not working then refactor the code and use **selenium**_-
- [ ] Try and optimize the code more so the runtime of the script is lowered
- [ ] Add more functionality, possibly a way to visualize data
